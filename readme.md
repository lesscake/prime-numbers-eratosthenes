These are 2 different programs to generate all prime numbers between 0 and N. One is using a naive solution, the other is using the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

I wrote a step by step tutorial on how this works here: **[lesscake.com/prime-numbers-eratosthenes](https://www.lesscake.com/prime-numbers-eratosthenes)**.

To test the programs, simply run `python naive.py` or `python eratosthese.py`.
